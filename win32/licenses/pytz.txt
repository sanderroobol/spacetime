This package is the result of an automatic generation from the Olsen database
(available from ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub). This means that there are two
licenses involved, that of the original distribution and the automatic
generation code. Fortunately both are BSD style.

Both are included here as they are quite different from the standard BSD style
license distributed with Debian.
