    of the motivations behind the licencing choice, see Licenses.
    License agreement for matplotlib.

    1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between John D. Hunter ("JDH"), and

    2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement,
    JDH hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
    world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or
    display publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and

    of copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2002-2008 John D. Hunter; All
    Rights Reserved" are retained in matplotlib alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

    3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based
    on or incorporates matplotlib or any part thereof, and wants to
    make the derivative work available to others as provided herein,
    then Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief
    summary of the changes made to matplotlib.

    4. JDH is making matplotlib available to Licensee on an ΄AS IS‘
    basis. JDH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, JDH MAKES NO AND
    DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
    FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF MATPLOTLIB
    WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

    5. JDH SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF
    MATPLOTLIB FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING
    MATPLOTLIB, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

    6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a
    material breach of its terms and conditions.

    7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between JDH
    and Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to
    use JDH trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse
    or promote products or services of Licensee, or any third party.
